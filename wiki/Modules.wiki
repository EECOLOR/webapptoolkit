#summary Modules information

= Modules =

The !WebAppToolkit consists of several modules. Core is the only module you need to create a very simple web application. You can add other modules to expand the capabilities of the [Core] module and get extra tools to build your web application.

Modules are usually installed from within the {{{configureControllers}}} method like this:

{{{
install(new ModuleName());
}}}

In some cases you might want to override a particular binding in a module. The code below overrides some bindings and then installs the result.

{{{
install(Modules.override(new ModuleName()).with(new AbstractModule() {
	@Override
	protected void configure() {
		//create bindings
	}
}));
}}}
