#summary Navigation information

= Navigation =

The navigation module binds a {{{SiteMap}}} instance. This instance is a {{{Map<String, SiteMap>}}} and is filled using an {{{ActionRegistrationListener}}}. Every action that is registered gets a place in the {{{SiteMap}}}.

In order to prevent actions from being included in the {{{SiteMap}}} it provides an {{{@HideFromNavigation}}} annotation.
