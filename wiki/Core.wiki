#summary Core module information

= Core =

The core was written with two features in mind:

 * mapping requests to methods
 * converting request parameters to typed objects

These features gave rise to some extra features. If you want to convert strings into typed objects something can go wrong: we need a validation feature. To indicate what went wrong you need to supply messages: we need a localization feature.

Sometimes you want to be able to redirect to another page and keep information for that next request: we need a flash memory (from Grails and Rails) feature.
