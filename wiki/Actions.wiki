#summary Information about actions

Actions are public methods of [Controllers].

= Annotations =

To prevent a public method from becoming an action you need to annotate it with the {{{@Forbidden}}} annotation.

The http specification provides different request methods, !WebAppToolkit allows you to distinguish between 4 of them:

 * Get
 * Post
 * Put
 * Delete

If you want an action to available only with the {{{Get}}} request method you can annotate it with {{{@Get}}}. By default an action is available for all request methods.

= Return types =

An action can have two different return types: {{{void}}} and {{{Result}}}. If the action has {{{Result}}} as a return type and returns {{{null}}} it has the same effect as return type {{{void}}}: no result.

{{{Result}}} allows you to specify:

- character encoding (default is UTF-8)
- content type (default is text/html)
- content
- headers
- if this result may be wrapped
